# ParadigmSharp
**Warning: This is not for the faint-hearted. This is the most unnecessary and the most cursed and disgusting project i might have made in my life. Programmer's and viewer's discretion is advised.**

This is a project to combine every language i have learned in C#. This means as much JS, as much Haskell, As much   P Y T H O N and as much Assembly elements as possible.
Again this is not for the faint-hearted. This is the bottomless pit of hell of a project almost if it was made by satan himself.
